<!-- 1. In the line above starting "Parent-Version:", remove the
        "$Revision...$" from around the revision number,
        leaving just Parent-Version: and the number. -->

<!-- 2. Replace "baz" with the name of your project.
        You should be able to do this with search and replace;
        making sure that the search is case insensitive and
        that the case of the replacement matches the case
        of the string found. In Emacs, query-replace will do this
        when case-fold-search and case-replace are both non-nil
        and both search and replacement string are given in lower case. -->

<!-- 3. Of course update the actual information according to your project,
        such as mailing lists, project locations, and maintainer name.  -->

<!-- 4. You can use the patch-from-parent script to semi-automate

<h3>Introduction to nano-archimedes</h3>
<p>nano-archimedes is a Technology Computer Aided Design tool (TCAD)
for the simulation of various technology relevant situations involving
the dynamics of electrons such as the transport in nanometer scale
semiconductor devices (nanodevices) and the dynamics of N-body
problems in quantum chemistry. It is based on the <a href="http://www.nano-archimedes.com/download/Sellier_JCP-2015.pdf">Signed Particle
Formulation</a> of quantum mechanics, a (computationally convenient) phase-space
formalism which can simulate time-dependent quantum problems involving
single- and many-body systems.</p>

<h3>The Ethical Motivations, a New Paradigma in Science</h3>

<p>GNU nano-archimedes has been created after observing the situation in the field of quantum simulations around the world.
One easily observes that almost all codes developed for quantum simulations are non-free and/or proprietary codes.
That is a very bad situation, especially for academic purposes, since it forces people to reinvent the wheel
everytime a piece of code is needed. This surely slows down the progress of Science (immagine you had to
rediscover the Newtonian laws every time you need them...).</p>

<p>In the current situation, we have a huge amount of papers describing a lot of numerical methods for
advanced simulations of quantum systems, but it is still very complicated to access any of these codes,
on which one could build new and even more advanced methods.</p>

<p>Would not it be better if we could avoid duplication of efforts in Science and Technology?</p>

<p>That is why nano-archimedes has been created...</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>The following two papers are strongly suggested in order to start
 with nano-archimedes and the theory and method behind it:</p>

<p>J.M. Sellier,<br>
"A Signed Particle Formulation of Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics",<br>
Journal of Computational Physics, Volume 297, Pages 254â€“265, DOI: 10.1016/j.jcp.2015.05.036, (2015).</p>

<p>J.M. Sellier, M. Nedjalkov, I. Dimov,<br>
"An introduction to applied quantum mechanics in the Wigner Monte Carlo formalism",<br>
Physics Reports, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157315001982">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157315001982</a>, (2015).</p>

<p>You can understand the algorithm developed in nano-archimedes and extend it to
2D and 3D spaces by reading this paper:</p>

<p>J.M.~Sellier, M.~Nedjalkov, I.~Dimov, S.~Selberherr,<br>
   A benchmark study of the Wigner Monte-Carlo method, Monte Carlo Methods and Applications,<br>
   De Gruyter, DOI: 10.1515/mcma-2013-0018, (2014).</p>

<p>You can utilize this code for density functional theory (DFT) calculations
   by following the details reported in the this paper:</p>

<p>J.M.~Sellier, I.~Dimov,<br>
   A Wigner Monte Carlo Approach to Density Functional Theory,<br>
   Journal of Computational Physics 270, pp. 265-277, (2014).</p>

<p>You can generalize this code to the time-dependent quantum many-body
   problem (ab-initio) by following the instructions reported in this
   paper:</p>

<p>J.M.~Sellier, I.~Dimov,<br>
   The Many-body Wigner Monte Carlo Method for Time-dependent Ab-initio Quantum Simulations,<br>
   Journal of Computational Physics 273, pp. 589-597 (2014).</p>
